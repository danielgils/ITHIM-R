#' ## Definition of a trip
#' 1. *Trip:* I couldn't find the exact definition of a trip in the 
#' documentation, so I assume that there were no constraints of duration or 
#' distance in walking trips, i.e., I included all trips collected.
#' 
#' 2. *Collection:* Trips collected in this survey correspond to those made the 
#' day of reference, i.e., the day and night before the survey (last 24 hours) 
#' (page 24, Modulo III from **File2**).
#' 
#' **Results presented are for trips made in a single day.**
#' 
#' 
#' ## Replicate main results from raw datasets
#' To create this report I have to set the full route of each file, regardless
#' the location of the working directory.
#'

#' ### Number of rows
#' The first thing to do is verify that the number of households and Macrozones 
#' in the dataset are the same to what is mentioned in page 5 of **File1**.

#' These values are the same as reported. However I could not replicate any 
#' other result because these datasets don't have sampling weights, and every 
#' number in **File1** was estimated using them.
#' 
#' ### Number of hh in trip dataset
#' First I have to make sure that there are no duplicates in the hh dataset.
length(unique(hh$ID_HOGAR)) == nrow(hh)

#' Since this is ok, then I have to see whether the number of hh in the trip 
#' dataset is the same that in the hh dataset
length(unique(trips$ID_HOGAR)) == nrow(hh)

#' These households don't have trips recorded. Here's a couple of cases 
#' (randomly chosen)
trips[trips$ID_HOGAR == "3001827",]
trips[trips$ID_HOGAR == "305914",]

#' Since there are hh without trips, I want to see whether there are trips 
#' without hh information. The following output suggest that it's not the case.

#' Check first that there are no duplicates in people dataset.
people <- people %>% 
  mutate(participant_id_paste = paste(ID_HOGAR, ORDEN_MORADOR, sep = "-"))

#' in the questionnaire. Here's a couple of cases (randomly
#' chosen)
trips[trips$participant_id_paste == "102776-257",]
trips[trips$participant_id_paste == "80621-35",]

#' Since there are people without trips, I want to see whether there are trips 
#' without people information. The following output suggest there is one trip
#' without personal information, and when looking for it in the people dataset
#' it doesn't appear. Therefore, these trips are going to be removed (later).

#' # **Preprocessing phase**
#' ## Filtering people from Medellin only
#' Since the survey was conducted in 10 municipalities and we are only interested
#' in Medellin, then these trips are the only ones used. I could've used the
#' information of other municipalities, if there had been data about injuries in 
#' these locations, but unfortunately we only have injuries in Medellin.
people_medellin <- people %>% 
  inner_join(hh[,c("ID_HOGAR", "NOM_MUNICIPIO")], 
             by = "ID_HOGAR") %>% 
  filter(NOM_MUNICIPIO == "Medellin")

#' I verify that there are no duplicates in people dataset
people_medellin <- people_medellin %>% 
  mutate(participant_id_paste = paste(ID_HOGAR, ORDEN_MORADOR, sep = "-"))
length(unique(people_medellin$participant_id_paste)) == nrow(people_medellin)

#' ## Classification and translation of trip modes
#' Nowhere in the documentation says something about the process to define the
#' trip main mode of transport. I asked directly to people from Medellin and 
#' they told me there was hierarchy (like in Bogota) but they didn't send it to
#' me. As a consequence I decided to create this hierarchy based on the 
#' information I have from Bogota. 
#' This is the result:
main_mode <- read_excel("C:/Users/danie/Documents/Daniel_Gil/Consultorias/2020/WorldBank/Data/Colombia/Hierarchy.xlsx", sheet = "Medellin")
main_mode %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' The first column of this table have all modes found in trip dataset. The
#' second column has a classification where some of the modes are grouped into
#' bigger categories (I created it in Spanish). Third column has its equivalence
#' so it can be used in the package taking into account travel modes defined in
#' standardized_modes file (.../ITHIM-R/data/global/modes/standardized_modes.csv)
#' . Last column has the hierarchy I created to define the trip main mode. The 
#' smaller the number, the more important the mode is.
#' 
#' Now with respect to trip purpose, I only had to translate them. This is the
#' result:
#table(trips$DESC_MOTIVO_VIAJE, trips$MOTIVO_VIAJE)
purpose <- read_excel("C:/Users/danie/Documents/Daniel_Gil/Consultorias/2020/WorldBank/Data/Colombia/Hierarchy.xlsx", sheet = "Cali_purpose")
purpose %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' The first two columns have been taken from the dataset, and the third column
#' is the translation and classification of these motives. 
#' 
#' ## Information at stage or trip level?
#' There is information at stage level although it seems that is not enough 
#' because of the duration of each stage. 
#' To understand how the information was collected at stage level, I selected a
#' person at random and tried to understand what modes person took to get to its
#' destination. The person selected has ID_HOGAR = 309974, ID_MORADOR = 2 and
#' SEC_VIAJE = 6.
#' 
trips %>% filter(ID_HOGAR == "309974", ID_MORADOR == "2", 
                        SEC_VIAJE == "6") %>% 
  select(ID_HOGAR, ID_MORADOR, SEC_VIAJE, HORA_O, HORA_D, DESC_MODO_TTE_E1,
         DESC_MODO_TTE_E2, DESC_MODO_TTE_E3, DESC_MODO_TTE_E4, DEC_MODO_TTE_E5,
         DESC_MODO_TTE_E6, DESC_MODO_TTE_E7) %>% 
  mutate(HORA_O = format(ISOdatetime(1900,1,1,0,0,0, tz = "GMT") + 
                                      as.difftime(as.numeric(HORA_O)*24, 
                                                  unit = "hours"), "%H:%M"),
         HORA_D = format(ISOdatetime(1900,1,1,0,0,0, tz = "GMT") + 
                                     as.difftime(as.numeric(HORA_D)*24, 
                                                 unit = "hours"), "%H:%M"),) %>%
  kbl() %>% kable_classic()

#' From this table I can see that the person started her trip at 17:00, and 
#' walked a block to get the metro. Then she took a bus (ruta integrada) to 
#' finally walk a block to get to her destination at 18:00.
#' 
#' Here it's clear that she walked before and after the public transport, and 
#' even though it says that she walked a block we can estimate somehow the 
#' duration of these stages. However it is not possible to know how much time
#' she was in the metro and in the bus.
#' 
#' **For this reason I conclude that even though there's information at stage**
#' **level, it's not enough to get the duration for each stage. Therefore,**
#' **I will continue working at trip level, and to get the trip mode I will**
#' **define the mode with highest priority.**
#' 
#' **ToDo: since the proportion of trips with more than one stage is relatively**
#' **small, we could compute the difference between the trip duration and the**
#' **time spent walking to the PT, and then split this duration equally in the**
#' **remaining modes. In this way, we used all information provided for trips**
#' **with only one stage and have a rough estimate of duration for trips with**
#' **more than one stage.**
#' 
#' ## Row for each trip, translate trip_mode and create duration, sex and age
#' Trip dataset already has a row for each trip, so I have to create the 
#' variables I need.
